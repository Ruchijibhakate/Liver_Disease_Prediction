# **Liver Disease Prediction: Early Detection & Prevention** 🏥🔬  

Hello LinkedIn community! 👋🏼  

I’m excited to share a **machine learning project** that leverages **data science in healthcare** to predict **liver disease** early. 📊 Using **clinical data**, I built a **predictive model** that helps identify high-risk individuals, allowing for early intervention and prevention.  

The dataset includes essential **health indicators** that contribute to liver disease. Through **EDA, feature engineering, and ML algorithms**, I analyze the data and develop a classification model. 🚀  

## **Key Questions Explored:**  
🔹 What are the most significant factors influencing liver disease?  
🔹 How accurately can machine learning models predict liver disease?  
🔹 Which classification algorithm performs best?  

By applying **data science in healthcare**, this project demonstrates how **predictive analytics** can improve early diagnosis and patient care.
